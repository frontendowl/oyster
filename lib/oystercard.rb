=begin
2 touch ins without touch out 
  - fix by checking if in journey in touch in

touch out when start station is nil
 -fix by initializing Journey in touch_out

 create method to add 
 


 1. init
 2. top_up
 3. deduct (private)
 4. touch_in
 5. touch_out
 6. add_journey
 
 @jouneys = []
 @balance

 REMOVE:

 1. in_journey?
 do we need @entry_station as an instance variable
